# Q1: Substitution Cipher
1.1 XXXXXXXXXX
1.2

My approach was to read in the text file as binary and store 
every eight bits as a byte and perform a frequency analysis 
on those bytes.

I would accomplish this by:

1.3 brief definition
1.4 brief explanation

# Q2: Frequency Analysis
2.1 0.0000E-00
2.2 0.0000E-00
2.3 
  yz: 0.0000E-00
  xyz: 0.0000E-00
  wxyz: 0.0000E-00
  vwxyz: 0.0000E-00
  uvwxyz: 0.0000E-00
  
2.4 briefly describe and explain trend


2.5 yz: 0.0000E-00
  xyz: 0.0000E-00
  wxyz: 0.0000E-00
  vwxyz: 0.0000E-00
  uvwxyz: 0.0000E-00
2.6 briefly compare and explain results
2.7 
  length=2: 0.0000E-00
  length=3: 0.0000E-00
  length=4: 0.0000E-00
  length=5: 0.0000E-00
2.8 briefly explain attack variant
